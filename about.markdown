Hello!!

Thanks for taking the time to read my blog. I was born and raised in India. I like to watch movies, netflix. and my favorite show is The Office, I love comedy and I watch most kind of movies except for horror. My dream is to get a business degree in world's to institutes and move into higher managment position. I also dream to start my own vertical farming company one day. I believe farming teaches patience, hardwork. It certainly helped me become better person than I was. I also like to cook and have recently started to bake. I love pizza and like to try out local pizzerias whenever I can. I like to workout, swim and play basket ball. I like watching and playing sports like tennis, soccer, cricket.

  Hello!!! I'm Sai Koushik, Chituluri. I did my bachelors in India in Electronics and Communication Engineering later came to States to do my Master’s in computer science at Northern Illinois University. I really enjoyed my time during masters. I got opportunity to work with great professors and people from various parts of the world. In free time I like to watch Netflix, workout, go hiking, running, watch movies.
  I want to work in a company where I have challenges constantly and collaborative space where co-workers are friendly. I like a challenge that pushes me to think uniquely and so something new. I would like to use my skills to be a part of organization that cares about work-life balance. Everyone I worked with appreciated my leadership skills, I have always been ready to stand up and lead from my childhood. I have been elected as the leader in my school to lead a group and successfully won the sports championship and during my time at Capgemini, I filled in a leadership vacuum when senior developers were not available and lead an offshore team. Below is a detailed look at my employment history. Thanks for taking the time to visit.
